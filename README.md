## Background

This project analyzes job postings from various sources, including LinkedIn, to uncover trends in the data analyst and business analyst roles. It aims to provide insights that help job seekers and professionals identify top-paying roles, understand in-demand skills, and make informed decisions about career and skill development.

The analysis focuses on answering the following key questions:

3. What skills are most in-demand for remote data analyst and business analyst roles?

5. What is the optimal skill to learn based on both demand and salary?

# Tools Used

For this project, listed down below are the key tools that made this analysis possible:

- **SQL:** Used to allow for queries from the initial job postings csv files.
- **PostgreSQL:** Initially learning MySQL, this project served as a good transition into learning database management systems.
- **Git & GitHub:** Utilized for its version control capabilities as well as sharing and tracking the project as a whole

# Analysis

Focusing on specific aspects of the data provided, each query gives valuable insights about the job market.

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To identify which roles paid the highest, the data was filtered to the postings whose short job titles were either "Data Analyst" or "Business Analyst". To ensure the rows remaining would be valuable, an additional step was done to ensure that the data left had data for salary and was not null. Finally, to fit this data more to my specific context, the data was filtered to locations listed either in the Philippines, or listed as Anywhere.
